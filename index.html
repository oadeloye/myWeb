            Hello and welcome to my personal website! I’m a web developer with a background in education 
            and student support services. I recently completed training in modern web technologies, including React, 
            and built this site to showcase my learning journey and interests. 
            </p>
            <p>
            On this page, you’ll find more about my professional experience, technical skills, and personal passions. 
            I’ve included sections on my education, a summary of my work in academic and career advising, and a gallery 
            of travel and race photos that highlight some of the things I love most; connecting with others, 
            staying active, and exploring new places.
            </p>

                So, let’s talk about how I got to where I am. I got my master's degree in school counseling in 2016. 
                I also sat and passed the NCE exam; that’s for community counseling. But I didn’t feel like community
                 counseling was my calling. I was more passionate about School counseling. Anyway, I started working 
                 as a school counselor that same year, and I did the job for about 9 years in various roles, but in 
                 the same field. My interest in coding came from my friends, my DND friends. I started playing Dungeons
                  and Dragons during the pandemic, courtesy of a friend who introduced me to the group. Many of the
                   participants were coders, and they talked about their jobs. I wanted to understand what they were 
                   talking about, so I started taking some coding classes. I started with Python. I had no idea what the 
                   language was about, despite being able to complete the assignments. Afterward, I took an HTML and CSS
                    class, and that was when it started to click. I am a visual person, and HTML is mostly visual; I can
                     see the output of the code. Then I took HTML, which is a front-end language and can be used in combination 
                     with HTML. I always thought coders memorize all the languages, but I am now finding out that it’s helpful 
                     to have a refresher with any new language you’re writing. Also, the majority of the languages are quite 
                     similar. For instance, they mostly have functions/methods. They all have ways of declaring an object. 
                     Most of them differentiate between integers and strings. Overall, the experience has been great and my goal 
                     this summer is to create projects with this languages and add to my website. React will be a difficult since 
                     the file would be larger than Github would allow. Anyway, Journey before destination, Radiant!
