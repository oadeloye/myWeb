            Hello and welcome to my personal website! I’m a web developer with a background in education 
            and student support services. I recently completed training in modern web technologies, including React, 
            and built this site to showcase my learning journey and interests. 
            </p>
            <p>
            On this page, you’ll find more about my professional experience, technical skills, and personal passions. 
            I’ve included sections on my education, a summary of my work in academic and career advising, and a gallery 
            of travel and race photos that highlight some of the things I love most; connecting with others, 
            staying active, and exploring new places.
            </p>
            <p>
            Feel free to check out my resume (CV), browse some of my projects, or just learn a bit more about me.
